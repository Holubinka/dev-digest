# Insights — client/

Failures and surprises specific to the web app. Repo-wide ones live in the root
`INSIGHTS.md`. Seven fixed sections, append-only —
`../.claude/skills/engineering-insights/SKILL.md` holds the rules.

## Codebase Patterns

### Run-level data reaches the PR-detail subtree by joining in `FindingsTab`, not by widening `ReviewRecord`

**Symptom.** You need something that lives on the run row (cost, tokens, duration) inside
a component that only receives a `ReviewRecord` — `ReviewRunAccordion`, `VerdictBanner` —
and the obvious move is to add the field to the review contract on the server.

**Cause.** A review and its run are separate rows joined by `run_id`; `ReviewRecord`
deliberately carries no run telemetry.

**Fix.** Don't widen the contract. `FindingsTab` already receives **both**
`runs: ReviewRecord[]` and `prRuns: RunSummary[]`, so build
`new Map(prRuns.map(r => [r.run_id, r]))` and pass the matched `RunSummary` down. This is
how the verdict plaque got its cost badge on 2026-07-28 — zero server changes, zero
contract churn. Check that map before touching `server/src/vendor/shared`.

## Tool & Library Notes

### A component test fails on `ResizeObserver is not defined`

**Symptom.** A chart or layout-aware component throws in jsdom.

**Cause.** jsdom does not implement `ResizeObserver`.

**Fix.** The polyfill is already registered in `src/test/setup.ts`. If a new test file
misses it, confirm the setup file is still wired through `vitest.config.ts`.

## Recurring Errors & Fixes

### An unexpected `severity` value takes down the whole findings page

**Symptom.** The PR detail page renders only a Next.js error overlay:
`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'icon')` at
`src/vendor/ui/primitives/Badge.tsx:62` → `SeverityBadge` → `FindingCard`.

**Cause.** `SEV` in `src/vendor/ui/primitives/tokens.ts` defines exactly four keys —
`CRITICAL`, `WARNING`, `SUGGESTION`, `INFO` — and `SeverityBadge` does
`const s = SEV[severity]; const I = Icon[s.icon];` with no fallback. Any other value in
`findings.severity` (the DB column is plain `text`, not an enum) dereferences `undefined`
and takes the whole route down rather than degrading to one bad badge. Hit on 2026-07-28
by hand-writing a fixture row with `severity='MAJOR'`.

**Fix.** Use only the four values when seeding or hand-writing findings. If a row is
already wrong:
`docker exec devdigest-postgres psql -U devdigest -d devdigest -c "UPDATE findings SET severity='WARNING' WHERE severity NOT IN ('CRITICAL','WARNING','SUGGESTION','INFO');"`.
`STATUS_META` and `VERDICT_META` guard their lookups with `?? default`; `SEV` does not.

### A field from the API arrives `undefined` with no error anywhere

**Symptom.** A component renders blank or crashes on `.map` of `undefined`, while the
network tab shows the request succeeded.

**Cause.** `src/lib/api.ts` types responses through generics but never calls `.parse()`.
The declared TypeScript type is an assertion, not a check, so a server response that no
longer matches passes straight through to the component.

**Fix.** When a shape looks wrong, compare against the server's Zod contract rather than
trusting the client type. If the mismatch is structural, fix the contract; if you need a
guarantee at the boundary, validate explicitly at the call site.

### A shared contract differs from the server's copy

**Symptom.** A union type or interface has a member on the server that TypeScript
insists does not exist here — or the reverse.

**Cause.** `@devdigest/shared` is vendored separately into each package with nothing
syncing them, and type-checking cannot see the difference. The copies drifted once
already (resynced 2026-07-27).

**Fix.** `server/src/vendor/shared/` is the source of truth, since `reviewer-core`
aliases it. Port the change and verify with
`diff -r ../server/src/vendor/shared src/vendor/shared`. The `shared-sync` CI gate
enforces this on every change to either copy.

Read the diff before overwriting — last time, this package held the better version of
`contracts/trace.ts`, and a blind copy would have thrown it away.
